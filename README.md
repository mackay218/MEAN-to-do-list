    STRETCH GOALS

[x] Move the inputs into a form and use ng-submit so that the user can hit enter to       add a new task.
[x] Add front-end validation to the 'make-a-task' form.
[] Add a category field for the task. Allow users to filter by task category.
[] Adjust the logic so that completed tasks are brought to the bottom of the page,       where the remaining tasks left to complete are brought to the top of the list.
